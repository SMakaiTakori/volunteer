## CLI Project

Welcome to my Volunteer App! This app was created to help users find volunteer opportunities focused on reducing hunger in Atlanta, GA.

## Gems Required

 1) gem 'pry' (optional)
 2) gem 'nokogiri'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Volunteer

## Usage

In order to run the app, execute the 'run' file from the bin folder.
Instructions for this app will be provided as you enter input into the terminal.

The first prompt will welcome the user and ask you to type 'list' to see a list of volunteer opportunities. 

The second prompt will ask the user to enter 'yes' if they would like to see more details, rather than just the titles and organization name.

After inputting 'yes' there will be a third prompt asking the user to enter the number that corresponds to the opportunity they would like to get more details for.

Commands available:
1. list - brings up a numbered list of volunteer opportunities
2. yes - allows user to say they would like to see more details
3. no - automatically lets user quit the app
